  <Title>excel add-n no longer loads since windows 10 upgrade</Title>
  <DescriptionHtml xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[Hi, My add-in was working fine till the upgrade .
Now it refuses to load. I cleaned the registry and built a fresh built then looked for a reference in the vba tool and none existed, I found the reference and ticked it but it was removed again by excel. Some other addins are also no longer loading.
I suspect the add-in has caused some security concern and been blacklisted or something.
Does anyone have any advice?

Thanks in advance]]></DescriptionHtml>

      <BodyHtml xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[I need to know. your addin is: 

1) an addin purely based on IExtensibility2 interface2) based on COMAddin class from NetOffice tools.


moreover your current NetOffice version. 

Please check also your LoadBehavior registry entry in "Software/Microsoft/Office/Excel/Addins/$YourAddin" (Found in HKEY_LOCAL_USER OR LOCAL_MACHINE or in Wow node on 64 bit systems)


Please check also MS-Excel didnt block the mscoree.dll in disabled items.

      <BodyHtml xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[Thanks Sebastian, This is revealing. I am usng a 64 bit system and the solution uses COM adin class from Netoffice.I did not develop the cod, but this I can recognise easily. I was a develpor until 2003 and was familiar with COM, though early oud methods
 were more usual.I have tried to step thrugh but can;t find a way to do this form visual studio 2013 in the way I used to do with vb6 and COM early bound.


Checkig the registry, I can find no reference to the addin either in the wow node or HKEY_LOCAL_USER OR LOCAL_MACHINE.Perhaps someting is not right about how it builds?
