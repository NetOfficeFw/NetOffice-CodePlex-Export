      "Message": "hello,let me explain, NetOffice is a fully 1:1 Wrapper to the Microsoft Office COM Automation Modell. NetOffice is a dirty little helper, not a library with an own idea. You have to know the basics to create a simple Office Addin. Sorry, i'm, a single person i try to help but its not easy for me.\r\n\r\nOkay!\r\n\r\n1. Just open a NetOffice Sample Addin Solution. You find a solution in the donwloaded release or latest source state. Just klick in the Solution Explorer with a right click on your main solution. Now you see special with some options. Please click on Debugging(or something like that, sorry ia'm german..) Now click on the radio button \"Start External Program\" and coose your desired Office Application. Now save the solution and start debugging. you will see all your breakpoints and so in works fine ;)",
