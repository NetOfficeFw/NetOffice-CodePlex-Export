      "Message": "Have you include all netoffice word assemblies as well ?I need to to know the missing class id from the NetOffice exception.\r\n\r\nLet me explain about NetOffice.OfficeApi.Document and NetOffice.WordApi.Document.NetOffice try to detect NetOffice.WordApi.Document as first. Unfortunately the MS Word developer team break the basic COM rules and some types are multiple defined in word and and the common office core with the same id. This is not allowed in the COM standard! i dont know why - but thats happen.NetOffice try to level this with looking for the application first and for the office main core after them.At the end you got a confusing exception about NetOffice.OfficeApi.Document - i'm sorry.As i implement that in year of 2010 - i dont realize this is may a problem for anyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
