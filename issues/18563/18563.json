This works well in VSTO, but in the NetOffice version, I get a COM exception stating that the function is not available in this situation ('De methode is niet beschikbaar in deze situatie' in dutch). But this is not ctritical for me  because I can use Windows.Forms messagebox as an alternative.",

I do not know if is the correct way to just leave it plain 'object', the Interop DLL has MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.Struct) as attribute. I leave that up to you as COM expert.\r\n\r\nThere may be more events like this (like ProjectBeforeTaskChange2 at least)\r\n--\r\n\r\nProjectBeforeTaskNew fires ok now (It did not in a previous version or I did not check it correctly) \r\n\r\nI also noticed there are a few events where there are two of them with the same name except for '2' at the end. They have slightly different parameters. I do not know why they are both available in Project, maybe some are left for backwards compatibility? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n \r\n",
