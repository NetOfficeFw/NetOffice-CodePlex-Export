Outlook icon in the task bar starts blinking. You have to bring it to the front, then the security dialog pops up for a short time and disapears. You get in big troubles because sometime you can't bring the dialog to the front\n- as this function only tries to click a button, it tries this also in other Outlook dialogs, which makes working with Outlook impossible\n\n\nThx in advance",
