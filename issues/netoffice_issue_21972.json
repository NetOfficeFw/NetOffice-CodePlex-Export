Not sure.\r\n\r\nThere's  no unblock dialog or something like that.And it is not all emails. So far, I only notice those that have problems are RTF format. Other emails in html or text format do not have problem getting the attachments.When I tried to create the problem by creating RTF emails with attachments on my laptop,there's no problem.So I'm not able to repeat the problem and I cannot install dev tools on the user's pc either. -_-\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?Thanks.",
