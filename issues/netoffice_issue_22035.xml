  <Title>Extracolors property is not IENumerable in powerpoint 2007</Title>
  <DescriptionHtml xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[Hi

I noticed (thorugh add-in failing) that in powerpoint 2007 the extracolors object does not act like a "real" collection, that is it does not implement the IEnumerable methods.

In effect it's impossible to iterate over the collection with foreach, instead one must use a for loop with own counter. Doing the latter is not a problem as such, but one could consider whereever the NetOffice proxy type should reflect this (i.e. be something
 else than a collection?)]]></DescriptionHtml>

      <BodyHtml xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[I'm currently figure out whats the problem. is it a collection in VBA or interop ???


*sry powerpoint content and development targets in netoffice is a bit slower from the flagships(excel, word, outlook) because we dont have enough users here. (please keep in your mind, its an open source project and i do all this in my free time)


what i can say is: NetOffice spend a 1:1 and better inferface to the inerop assemblies(also PowerPoint)but if its possible i want make the extracolors to an IEnumerable of course.(This is not easy - because i have to veryfiy this alwas these type - otherwise
 i can't do this)
