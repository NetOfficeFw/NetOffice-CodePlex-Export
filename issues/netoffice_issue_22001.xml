      <BodyHtml xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[Hi Sebastian, 

Thanks for the reply and the great product! 

I am referring to compatibility with the assembly in my microsoft visual studio 2010 path:


C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Visual Studio Tools for Office\PIA\Office14\Microsoft.Office.interop.access.dao.dll


The runtime version is: 

v2.0.50727 

And the version is: 

14.0.0.0 

I have Office 2010 installed as well and I believe this assembly corresponds to the version of Access from this version. There is a version conflict when trying to call DAO functions using the NetOffice API with this version of Access, and this specific version
 doesn't seem to exist in the header file (so intellisense doesn't show this). 

Let me know if I can clarify. Thanks!]]></BodyHtml>
