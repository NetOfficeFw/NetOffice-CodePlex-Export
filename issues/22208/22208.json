    "Description": "Hi\n\nI'm faced with a weird behavior.\nNet Office task panes are not visible anymore in Excel 2013 when an XLA is enabled.\nTo reproduce the problem, I used any of the samples provided creating a task pane, and I active an XLA.\nEach of \"Solver addin\", \"Euro currency tools\" and \"analysis toolpak\" XLA provided with Excel 2013 creates the problem.\n\nA workaround is to uncheck \"Show the Start screen when this application starts\" in Excel options \"General\" (at the bottom)\n\nAny idea what is going on ?\n\nThanks",
