  <Title>Resharper/MSpec Assembly bind erros with 1.5.1</Title>
  <DescriptionHtml xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[Hi Sebastian,
 
(I'm writing in English so others can also follow the discussion aas i gues this may affect more people then just me)
 
I've just upgraded to 1.5.1 and now all Specs (MSpec tests) that are using a running Excel instance (my intigraion test) fail with an assembly binding error for (Resharper.*.dlls) when running from Resharpers test runner.
When running from Commandline everything works. This is quite strange as i did not find any hint what happens in the NetOffice.dll causing reahsrper to fail resolving it's assemblies.
 
It is definatelly triggered by the NetOffice.dll as all tests not using the NetOffice API are working.
 
This is not a major issue for me as 1.4.1 is working perfectly - just wanted to let you know that there are some strange sideeffects triggered by NetOffice
