      "Message": "excel reject all programmatic access while calculate and edit cells but i'm wondering it works in interop. i want clearify the situation. as hotfix i suggest you to use interop. something like this:\r\n\r\nvar proxy = GetActiveObject(\"Excel.Application\");new NetOffice.ExcelApi.Application(null, proxy);\r\n\r\nor a process window technique that is demonstrated in latest source state (folder tests\\concept tests\\object from window) (this technique is used by default for GetActiveInstance(s) in NO 1.7, coming soon)\r\n\r\nSebastian ",
