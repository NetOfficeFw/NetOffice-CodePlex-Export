Especially BuiltInDocumentProperties and CustomDocumentProperties on Word.Document should have it.\nFor BuiltInDocumentProperties it should be possible to access an item using the WdBuiltInProperty enum (BuiltInDocumentProperties[WdBuiltInProperty.wdPropertyAuthor])",

If \"DocumentProperties\" is returned the indexer is present and the collections are enumerable (see my comment on #16739 as well).\r\n\r\nI attached the corrected document class\r\n",

With the VS2010 PIAs BuiltInDocumentProperties and CustomDocumentProperties seem to return a typed DocumentProperties collection. No cast is required.\r\nBut NetOffice has to support different .NET versions and does not support \"dynamic\". That's why a cast is required.",
