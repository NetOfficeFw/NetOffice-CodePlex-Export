This may require administrative priviledges and that's why the Visual Studio is complaining about insufficient admin rights.\n\nTo debug the TaskPane, you must change the project Debug properties - set the Start external program to point to your installed MS Outlook EXE file. If the Add-in is correctly registered, you can debug the Task Pane.",
