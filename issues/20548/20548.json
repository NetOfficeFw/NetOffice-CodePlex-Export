My application manipulates Excel Sheets using NetOffice from an external application not an addon.\r\n\r\nWhile Excel is running in RAM all goes right (including all functionalities) but when it is not running actually I get the exact same exception as in this issue mentioned.\r\n\r\nMy best guess is to just ignore this specific exception but I would like to have this solved in a more valid way.",
