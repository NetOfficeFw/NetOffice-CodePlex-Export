  <Title>Word that has opened from Sharepoint</Title>
  <DescriptionHtml xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[Hi, 

I have made an application that uses the WordApi.

When I am trying to "connect" with a word that is saved to a Sharepoint and then close it the next time that the Application.GetActiveInstance(); method is called, it does not respode.

Nothing is returned not even an exception, instead of this the application freezes at this line.]]></DescriptionHtml>
