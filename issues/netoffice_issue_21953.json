    "Description": "I have a web application that uses NetOffice ExcelAPI. All works okay on the local development machine, but when I deploy the application to the server and run the app I get a 500 error. The log file doesn't seem to register that such an event has occurred but, by process of elimination, I have determined it is the NetOffice ExcelAPI that triggers the 500 error.\n\nInterestingly, I have two other web applications on the same server using the same version of NetOffice.ExcelAPI that run without any issues.\n\nCan anyone offer any troubleshooting tips that might provide some light on why I get the 500 error?",
