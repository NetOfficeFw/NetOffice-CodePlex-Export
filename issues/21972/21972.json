    "Description": "Hi All,\n\nI encountered an exception while trying to get attachment filenames for an email in Outlook 2013 and wondering if anybody encountered this before?\n\nThe exception shows:\nat NetOffice.Invoker.PropertyGet(COMObject comObject, ...)\nat NetOffice.OutlookApi.Attachment.get_Filename()\n\nThis problem only happen with specific emails and not all.\nAnd it seems to be email in RichText format with embedded attachments.\nI tried to simulate this problem but did not encounter any problem on my own machine.\n\nAnybody else ever encounter this problem?\n\nThe code snippet is as follow:\n\nOutlook.Attachments olAttachments = _MailItem.Attachments;\n                    int iTotalAtts = 0;\n                    string AttachmentFolder = string.Empty;\n                    if (olAttachments != null)\n                    {\n                        iTotalAtts = olAttachments.Count;\n                        if (iTotalAtts > 0)\n                        {\n                            AttachmentFolder = _slMailObj.tmp_folder + Path.DirectorySeparatorChar + _slMailObj.mail_id + Path.DirectorySeparatorChar;\n                            Directory.CreateDirectory(AttachmentFolder);\n                        }\n\n                        int nCount = 1;\n                        foreach (Outlook.Attachment att in olAttachments)\n                        {\n                            string tmpAttachFile = AttachmentFolder + nCount.ToString(\"000\") + \"_\" + att.FileName;\n                            tmpAttachFile = wsFile.GetUniqueFileName(tmpAttachFile);\n                            att.SaveAsFile(tmpAttachFile);\n                            nCount++;\n                        }\n                    }\n\nThanks.",

(any exception log would be helpful)\r\n\r\n1) the operating system?2) solution is an addin?3) outlook is running with elevated rights?\r\n\r\nMy current idea is the content is blocked due security reasons. the content is accsessible for users without hurdles?(no unblock dialogs or something like this)\r\n\r\n*Sebastian\r\n\r\n",

      "Message": "Hi,The user is running Office 2010 32 bits.1. The OS is Win7 64 bits.2. Yes, it is an addin. Actually, I have 1 single addin for all 4 apps (Word, Excel, Ppt and Outlook).3. Not sure.\r\n\r\nThere's  no unblock dialog or something like that.And it is not all emails. So far, I only notice those that have problems are RTF format. Other emails in html or text format do not have problem getting the attachments.When I tried to create the problem by creating RTF emails with attachments on my laptop,there's no problem.So I'm not able to repeat the problem and I cannot install dev tools on the user's pc either. -_-\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?Thanks.",
