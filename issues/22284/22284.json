    "Description": "Decided to start a new thread as it is specific to Excel but I think it's the same macanisim as another thread called \"Class not exists: NetOffice.OfficeApi.Document\"\n\nMy issue is related to WorkbookConnection class\n\nI got a valid WorkbookConnection objet using:\n                    powerPivotConnection = book.Connections\n                        .OfType<WorkbookConnection>()\n                        .Where(n => n.Name == \"PowerPivot Data\" || n.Name == \"ThisWorkbookDataModel\")\n                        .FirstOrDefault();\n\nthen I use this to reconnect:\npowerPivotConnection.OLEDBConnection.Reconnect();\n\neverything is fine until I try to get this property:\npowerPivotConnection.OLEDBConnection.ADOConnection\n\nIt raises an Exception (stack here):\n\n   à NetOffice.Core.CreateObjectFromComProxy(IFactoryInfo factoryInfo, COMObject caller, Object comProxy, Type comProxyType, String className, String fullClassName)\n   à NetOffice.Core.CreateObjectFromComProxy(COMObject caller, Object comProxy)\n   à NetOffice.ExcelApi.OLEDBConnection.get_ADOConnection()\n   à Powerpivot_Refresh.ExcelUtilities.TryRefreshPowerPivot(Workbook book) dans c:\\Users\\pasielskyf\\Documents\\Dev\\PSO_tools\\Powerpivot_Refresh\\ExcelUtilities.cs:ligne 143\n   à PSO_tools.Addin.Btn_importDiver_Click(IRibbonControl Ctrl) dans c:\\Users\\pasielskyf\\Documents\\Dev\\PSO_tools\\PSO_tools\\Addin.cs:ligne 301\n\nI managed this using reflection as discussed in \"Class not exists: NetOffice.OfficeApi.Document\" topic, but I'm sure there is better to do.\n\nIf you need additionnal information, let me know",
