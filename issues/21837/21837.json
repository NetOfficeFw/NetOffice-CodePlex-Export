    "Description": "Hi,\n\nI migrated my WPF app from PIA v14 to NetOffice. I have problem with getting HWND (window handle) from PowerPoint. It was working on PIA v14, but when I try to access to __ppPresentation.SlideShowWindow.HWND__  property (ppPresentation is my PowerPoint presentation opened as SlideShow) with NetOffice, exception __\"Member not found. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80020003 (DISP_E_MEMBERNOTFOUND))\"__ is thrown. How I can get handle to SlideShow window using NetOffice? Other functiomns works ok.",

But with PIA libraries I got correct handle from SlideShowWindow.HWND all time (also with my workaround I got correct handle - it uses name of a presentation file in [] brackets to find correct SlideShow window - main PowerPoint window or window with presentation opened in edit mode don't contain these [] brackets around teh file name, so these windows are ignored). But with your workaround/extension method, returned handlers are incorrect, it contains probably random numbers that doen't correspond with any window.",
