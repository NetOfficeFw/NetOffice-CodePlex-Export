    "Description": "Hi,\n\nI've developed an extension based on NetOffice. My office configuration requires applications to be signed by Trusted Publishers. I tried signing the output DLL with signtool.exe, with a valid certificate, but unfortunately, Office says \"There is no digital signature available\".\n\nThe option can be enabled via: File->Options->Trust Center->Trust Center Settings -> Add-ins -> Require application Add-ins to be signed by Trusted Publisher\n\nWhat's the appropriate method for signing the DLL? \n\nIt seems that when using VSTO ClickOnce handles the signing, also there's a .manifest file that is created for the DLL, I'm not sure if its required or not but I'm unable to create one for class libraries.\n\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb772096(v=vs.120).aspx\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386179.aspx\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/che5h906.aspx",
