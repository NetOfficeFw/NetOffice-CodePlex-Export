    "Description": "Hi,\nI'm a new user of net office and I'm trying to make a ribbon addin to Excel. It's kind of a proof of concept to show it is possible to make a real powerfull/clean/maintainable development using .NET instead of writing tons of vba code (using sharpdevelop).\nOne of the basic feature I'm trying to show is to select a row in a sheet, click on a button and then insert a row just underneath the one selected.\nYou could write it in vba like this:\nSelection.Rows.insert()\nBut I can't find any Rows property (nor any Columns property) in Worksheet class (can't find it anywhere else). Then I tried to find methods provided by ExcelAPI DLL; I just found that Rows property exist but that Browsable attribute has been set to false.\nIs this expected? If so, how can I access that property to insert a row where I want?\n\nthank you",
