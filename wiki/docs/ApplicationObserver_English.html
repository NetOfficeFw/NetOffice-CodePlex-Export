<br>
</strong></span></p>
<p align="justify">If you are automating Office applications, it can easily happen that the COM-Proxies assigned to you are not freed correctly upon error, e. g. if you abort the debugging process too early.&#160; You Office Application is then not properly
 shut down and stays in memory. During longer development-sessions you can accumulate a bit number of zombie-instances, which may (depending on the Office application) causes problems.&#160; The Application Observer helps you in keeping an eye on one or more
 Office applications and -if you choose to- kill them via a hotkey. </p>
