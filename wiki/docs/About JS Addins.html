<p><strong>Javascript Addins in Microsoft Office</strong><br>
<br>
Well, we all see the Microsoft idea to bring Javascript addins to MS Office.<br>
I want to explain, whats my point of view here.<br>
<br>
<br>
The benefits are obvious.<br>
An addin on this high abstraction level can run everywhere. Browser/Mac/iPhone/Windows - as a service - they call it &quot;Cloud&quot;. This is a good idea, developers can extend the range of possible users. No question about it.<br>
thumbs up<br>
<br>
<br>
My problem is i dont like the idea that my addin is managed by Office 365.<br>
And i dont like the idea to stay online for my addin as developer and customer. I dislike that web api's eating the desktop. I dislike the idea needing Microsoft online to develop and publish my addin.<br>
Last but not least: i dont like JavaScript.<br>
<br>
I want develop and publish my addin private/offline in my own way coded in C# or VB.<br>
For JavaScript: I'm sure .Net Core want help here in time and then this way is growing up.<br>
My problem is not the idea of the API, my problem is how Microsoft handle that to make me online.<br>
<br>
<strong>I prefer COM addins as long as this is the only &quot;works offline&quot; way.</strong></p>
