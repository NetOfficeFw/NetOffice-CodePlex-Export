<br>
</strong></span></p>
<p align="justify">When you develop a ComAddin for Office you maybe face the problem that you are not sure whether your Addin have been loaded correctly. If an error occurs, Office applications change the LoadBehavior or put them in the area &quot;deactivated
 elements&quot;. This, however, is often not made obvious to you as a developer. Addin Guard can notify you when the LoadBehavior of an Addin changes or when it gets marked as deactivated Element.</p>

<p align="justify">If the LoadBehavior of your Addin changes from 3 (Load at Startup) to 2 (Load on Demand), it is mostly cause by the Office application because an error occured. Addin Guard can reset this value automatically for you. In this case you are
 notified by MessageBox or TrayBalloon that the value has been restored.</p>
