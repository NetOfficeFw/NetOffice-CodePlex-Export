All objects in NetOffice which are based on CoClasses or Interfaces are wrapping COM Proxies. It's necessary to release a created COM Proxy by the client caller.
This tells the COM Server (meaning your office application) that you do not need the instance any longer.

In the MS Interop Assemblies you do that with Marshal.ReleaseComObject(object proxy);
In NetOffice any object has the Method Dispose() to do that.
An implemented Proxy Table in NetOffice makes it possible that you do not have to call Dispose() for any (implicitly) created object.
This tutorial shows you how to use the Dispose() method to release an object and its created child objects.

See chapter1 and chapter5 in <a href="http://netoffice.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Tec_Documentation_English">technical documentation</a> for further info.
