<p><strong>NetOffice Situation Today</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
After 2-3 years of small succsess, NetOffice is obiously not so relevant anymore, if you believe the downloads and the postings.<br>
<br>
<strong>Why that?</strong></p>
<p>As starts in year of 2010, the situation for office developers was not very comfortable if there want support the actual and the last 2-3 Office versions. multiple VSTO versions works only together with some selected and office/.net runtime versions.&nbsp;
 Moreover the breaking change in year of 2007 confuse people. the release periods was much shorter as now and keep developers under pressure.<br>
<br>
<strong>Now?<br>
<br>
</strong>Now, in year of 2017, VSTO supports the actual and last 3 office versions in the defacto standard runtime .Net 4.x There is no reason anymore for developers to leave a comfortable full service API like VSTO and its impossible to be a worthy VSTO opponent
 as a private hobby project.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<strong>Future?</strong><br>
<br>
Microsoft left the COM API but i do not. I want continue contribute Netoffice(1.7.4.1) but without developing new major features.&nbsp; Just bugfixing/improvements/enhancements. Next Year - Office 2019 comes out. We will see VSTO is still working in Office
 2019 or cards mixed again. i wait for that chance - do me the pleasure Microsoft.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>Trivia</strong><br>
May some web devolopers told you the COM API is depricated. There is no official MS announcement here and Microsoft has a lot of BIG business customers with COM API software for a loooong time.
