<p>NetOffice needs powerful Linq extensions, querys for excel ranges or outlook contacts.<br>
but the first step is an overwrite of the standard linq extensions. this is a special challenge because NetOffice deals with COM Interop and latebinding. this means in a WHERE query you have to free all objects without using to keep the count of open COM proxies
 low. a simple C# example for an Excel.Range WHERE extension:<br>

public static IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; Where&lt;T&gt;(this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; source, Func&lt;Excel.Range,int, bool&gt; predicate) where T : IDisposable<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; foreach (T item in source)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (predicate(item as Excel.Range, 1))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yield return item;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; item.Dispose();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}<br>
<br>
example call:<br>
<br>
Excel.Range targetRange = (from range in worksheet.Range(<a href="/wikipage?title=%22%24A1%3a%24G14&referringTitle=">&quot;$A1:$G14</a>) where range.Value == &quot;SearchValue&quot;<br>
select range).FirstOrDefault();<br>
<br>
this is just for me with my basic linq knowledge. if you mean you can do that better, please contact me.<br>
no commercial or free APi has true Linq support at the moment. you have the chance to create a new way to use ms-office. a lot of things more what i have to say but anyway, contact me and lets talk about.

<br>
what do you have from NetOffice:<br>
NetOffice is a young idea but the project has a successful start. for the future, you have a better reputation as team member from NetOffice for your career as developer. sometimes you busy? that's okay. of course, the real life is more important.<br>
<br>
advanced stuff:<br>
its possible you think this idea is impossible with combined linq queries. yes, for typical .net scenarios, its impossible. the Dispose() call kills the objects, the dead for a static sequence in local memory. but in NetOffice you got a new proxy in any call
 you do(fire and forget also for enumerators) thats the reason for it works well.<br>
