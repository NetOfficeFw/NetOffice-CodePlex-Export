    "Description": "Hi Sebastian,\n\nwhile I was trying to add names automatically i discovered the following:\n\nIf I add a name in VBA i always have to use the english formula (in the RefersTo parameter; as described under https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/office/ff835300.aspx the formula needs to be in english).\n\nExample: I want to add a formula in german \"=BEREICH.VERSCHIEBEN(A1;0;0;10;1)\". To add this formula automatically via VBA i would write something like\n\n```\nSub example()\n    ActiveWorkbook.Names.Add Name:=\"name\", RefersTo:=\"=Offset($A$1,0,0,10,1)\"\nEnd Sub\n```\n\na new name \"=BEREICH.VERSCHIEBEN(Tabelle1!$A$1;0;0;10;1)\" is created in my Workbook (I have a german installation).\n\nHowever, this doesn't work with NetOffice. I tried 2 versions.\n\n1. This one simply crashes with an error that says that this is not a correct formula\n```\nActiveSheet.Names.Add(\"name\", \"=Offset($A$1,0,0,10,1)\");\n```\n\n2. Replaced \",\" with \";\"\n```\nActiveSheet.Names.Add(\"name\", \"=Offset($A$1;0;0;10;1)\");\n```\n\nThis results in a new name with the formula \"=Offset($A$1;0;0;10;1)\" but of course my german version does not know \"offset\".\n\nSo i guess that there is some sort of translation from the english formula version to your local language which is currently nut supported by NetOffice. Couly you please have a look? Happy to provide additional details if needed.\n\nregards,\n\ncoheedld",
