    "Description": "Hi\n\nI noticed (thorugh add-in failing) that in powerpoint 2007 the extracolors object does not act like a \"real\" collection, that is it does not implement the IEnumerable methods.\n\nIn effect it's impossible to iterate over the collection with foreach, instead one must use a for loop with own counter. Doing the latter is not a problem as such, but one could consider whereever the NetOffice proxy type should reflect this (i.e. be something else than a collection?)",

      "Message": "I'm currently figure out whats the problem. is it a collection in VBA or interop ???\r\n\r\n*sry powerpoint content and development targets in netoffice is a bit slower from the flagships(excel, word, outlook) because we dont have enough users here. (please keep in your mind, its an open source project and i do all this in my free time)\r\n\r\nwhat i can say is: NetOffice spend a 1:1 and better inferface to the inerop assemblies(also PowerPoint)but if its possible i want make the extracolors to an IEnumerable of course.(This is not easy - because i have to veryfiy this alwas these type - otherwise i can't do this)\r\n\r\n*Sebastian\r\n\r\n",
