If I then move the folder to my SharpDevelop working directory this message is returned \" Access to the path 'Custom\\MyAssembly\\MyAssembly' is denied. | UnauthorizedAccessException | Void WinIOError(Int32, System.String)\"\n\nSurely \"Custom\" should be replaced with the input directory name?\n\nRegards",
