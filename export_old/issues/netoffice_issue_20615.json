In fact I used the same MSI (compiled with WiX) to install my addin that runs fine on Windows 7 32-bit, and still no go.\r\n\r\nLooks like NetOffice is simply broken on Windows 8 / 8.1 64-bit with Office 2013 installed, even if Office 2013 is 32-bit or 64-bit, even if you have a parallel install of Office 2010. :(",
