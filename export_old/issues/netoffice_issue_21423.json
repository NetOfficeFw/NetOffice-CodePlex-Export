    "Description": "When iterating through Range.Fields, after calling field.Update() (which may update the list of fields in Word), there's an issue with the iterator of fields.

The problem in NO is the enumerator get one more field proxy as expected(see below).I want fix this as fast as possible but if you need a change today you can modify the NO code at hand of course(just switch 2 code lines in 2 methods).\r\n\r\nLocation:    Utils.cs (NetOffice.dll)Methods:  IEnumerator GetProxyEnumeratorAsProperty(COMObject comObject)  IEnumerator GetProxyEnumeratorAsMethod(COMObject comObject)\r\n\r\nWrong Code:COMObject returnClass = Factory.CreateObjectFromComProxy(enumerator, itemProxy);isMoveNextTrue = (bool)Invoker.MethodReturnWithoutSafeMode(enumerator, \"MoveNext\", null);yield return returnClass;\r\n\r\nCorrect Code:COMObject returnClass = Factory.CreateObjectFromComProxy(enumerator, itemProxy);yield return returnClass;isMoveNextTrue = (bool)Invoker.MethodReturnWithoutSafeMode(enumerator, \"MoveNext\", null);\r\n\r\n*Sebastian\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
