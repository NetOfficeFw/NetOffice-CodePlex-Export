I see my custom taskpane in my computer everything is fine but I need to deploy it to use my custom taskpane in other computers. How can I do that? I tried to register the .dll in RegAsm.exe but I got the following exception (see my main post).\r\n\r\nSorry for the English. Thank you very much for the help!",
