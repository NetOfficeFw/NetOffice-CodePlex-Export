I cleaned the registry and built a fresh built then looked for a reference in the vba tool and none existed, I found the reference and ticked it but it was removed again by excel.  Some other addins are also no longer loading.\nI suspect the add-in has caused some security concern and been blacklisted or something.\nDoes anyone have any advice?\n\nThanks in advance",

      "Message": "Thanks Sebastian, This is revealing. I am usng a 64 bit system and the solution uses  COM adin class from Netoffice.I did not develop the cod, but this I can recognise easily. I was a develpor until 2003 and was familiar with COM, though early oud methods were more usual.I have tried to step thrugh but can;t find a way to do this form visual studio 2013 in the way I used to do with vb6 and COM early bound.\r\n\r\nCheckig the registry, I can find no reference to the addin either in the wow node  or HKEY_LOCAL_USER OR LOCAL_MACHINE.Perhaps someting is not right about how it builds?\r\n\r\nEd",
