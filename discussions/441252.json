    "Html": "Hello,\r<br />\n<br />\nThere are several ways to do it.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe one I'm using is to say, that every object in Excel is a shape, which means it can have an AlternativeText<br />\n<pre><code>shape.AlternativeText</code></pre>\n\nNow, when I put an object into a row, I give him an alternative text<br />\n<pre><code>shape.AlternativeText = ConvertToAlphaColumnReferenceFromInteger(sheet.Application.ActiveCell.Column)+ sheet.Application.ActiveCell.Row</code></pre>\n\nIf you want to keep it's reference, while Drag&amp;Drop you can give him as Alternative text the current cell that you select.\r<br />\n<br />\nFor the procedure, you might want to look it up here: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/181596/how-to-convert-a-column-number-eg-127-into-an-excel-column-eg-aa\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/181596/how-to-convert-a-column-number-eg-127-into-an-excel-column-eg-aa</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nNow in order to simulate that object you can use the class<br />\n<pre><code>using System.Object;\nusing System.Windows.Forms.DragDropEffects;\nusing BrightIdeaSoftware.SimpleDragSource;</code></pre>\n\nWith those, you can work with the object and simulate the Drag and Drop.\r<br />\n<br />\nNow for your getters and setters.\r<br />\n<br />\nSince every object that you import, is actually a shape, you can access its properties with<br />\n<pre><code>worksheetnumber = 1;\nforeach (Excel.Worksheet sheet in workbook.Sheets)\n                    {\n                        sheet.Activate();\n                        workSheet = (Excel.Worksheet)xlsApp.Worksheets[worksheetnumber];\n                        Console.WriteLine(workSheet.Name);\n                        foreach (Excel.Range cell in workSheet.UsedRange)\n                        {\n                            int rowIndex = cell.Row;\n                            int columnIndex = cell.Column;\n                            if (cell.Text.Equals(&quot;&lt;some test&gt;&quot;))\n                            {    \n                                cell.Value = &lt;your new value&gt;\n                                //Console.WriteLine(&quot;Changement done.&quot; + cell.Text);\n                            }\n                        }\n                        worksheetnumber++;\n                    }</code></pre>\n\nIf you want to test what type the shape is of your object<br />\n<pre><code>shape.Type.ToString().Equals(&quot;msoTable&quot;);</code></pre>\n\nYou want probably to change your object/shape?<br />\n<pre><code>sheet.Range(&quot;A1&quot;).PasteSpecial(); //Paste a new object in your current row/column</code></pre>\n\nIf you want only the used data in your worksheet, you can use:<br />\n<pre><code>sheet.UsedRange</code></pre>\n\nI think, you have now enough answers to start with something.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf you are interested in something more complex, you might have a look at <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5124\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5124</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nOpen XML SDK, this is the next generation to work with.\r<br />\n<br />\nThis was one of my post and the reply of the forum master: <a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/officegeneral/thread/90e639e5-1acc-460a-bb02-094f089c3693\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/officegeneral/thread/90e639e5-1acc-460a-bb02-094f089c3693</a><br />\n",

When you do this, if your external application thread calls into Visual Studio and is rejected (that is, it returns SERVERCALL_RETRYLATER from the IOleMessageFilter.HandleIncomingCall method), then your application can handle it and either retry or cancel the call. To do this, initiate the new thread from your Visual Studio application in a single-threaded apartment (STA) and surround your automation code with the IOleMessageFilter handler.<br />\n</blockquote>\nWell, i've also read that NetOffice will accomplish the release of the COM objects for me. I have only to dispose the app like in the examples. Am i rght? So why I've got still SERVERCALL_RETRYLATER? I don't think that i have to implement an IOleMessageFilter.<br />\n<br />\nIsn't my console application per default a STAThread? Should i have to be aware about the COM?<br />\n<br />\nPlease don't misunderstand me, i appreciate the work in NetOffice! <br />\n",
