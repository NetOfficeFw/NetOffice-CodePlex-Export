I need to use my custom one.<br />\n<br />\nCurrently I'm using PictureDispConverter approach. However this solution has dependency on stdole.dll because of setting the button.Picture and button.Mask properties. I believe I can't remove the dependency while using this approach.<br />\n<br />\nI tried using button.PasteFace() approach in which case I can remove dependency on stdole.dll. However I did not find way of how to preserve transparency in the image. The image was always placed on gray non-transparent background as can be seen here: <a href=\"http://screencast.com/t/Rv63lPC7YTrn\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://screencast.com/t/Rv63lPC7YTrn</a> . I tried using PNG, Bitmap and Icon objects, always with the very same result.<br />\n<br />\nIs there a way how to set image with transparency (alpha channel) which does not depend on stdole.dll?<br />\n<br />\n(NOTE: My problem is related to classic UI of the Office suite.)<br />\n",
