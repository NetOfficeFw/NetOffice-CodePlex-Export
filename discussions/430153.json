For example I have the following New Sub:</p>\r\n<div style=\"background-color:white; color:black\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color:blue\">Public</span> <span style=\"color:blue\">Sub</span> <span style=\"color:blue\">New</span>()\r\n      togglePressed = <span style=\"color:blue\">False</span>\r\n<span style=\"color:blue\">End</span> <span style=\"color:blue\">Sub</span>\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>... and it doesn't prevent my PowerPoint addin from loading. Just a non-empty New Sub can't be a problem. May be you constructor code make something sensitive to addin loading (memory issue, unmanaged resource trick, COM object, etc.). What does you\r\n<em>dummy code</em> look like?</p>\r\n",
