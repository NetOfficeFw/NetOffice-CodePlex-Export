The customized setting that I want to achieved are as follows:\r<br />\n<br />\nuse the XP Render to display the image on the left hand side\r<br />\nhave custom lines (muliple rows of different fields) of text on the right hand side.\r<br />\nI know I have to use something similar to the following statement to change the render. I am using tile mode.\r<br />\n<br />\nImageListView1.SetRenderer(<br />\n<pre><code>New Manina.Windows.Forms.ImageListViewRenderers.TilesRenderer(180))</code></pre>\n\n",
