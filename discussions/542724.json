Could not locate the assembly &quot;extensibility, Version=7.0.3300.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a&quot;. Check to make sure the assembly exists on disk. If this reference is required by your code, you may get compilation errors. (MSB3245)\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen trying to run the project in SharpDevelop 5 I'm getting:\r<br />\nProject is configured as dll and no execution command is specified. \r<br />\nYou can specify an execution command in the project options.\r<br />\n<br />\nHow can I fix the errors?\r<br />\n<br />\nAre there docs about this?\r<br />\nI couldn't find any info and had to figure it out.\r<br />\nIs there an example how to use SharpDevelop with wix (or something else) to create an Office add-in installer?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks<br />\n",
