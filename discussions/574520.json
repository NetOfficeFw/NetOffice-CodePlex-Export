I am trying to figure out how to apply the icon in such a way that the 'natural' colour of the VBE shows through and the icon blends into the VBE.<br />\n<br />\nSo far I have:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>\nLooked at using button.Mask, but cannot see how to use it through NetOffice. My code is run as an add-in, so I'm 'in process' and feel I should be able to use this method.<br />\n</li>\n<li>\nUsing bitmap.MakeTransparent() on the icon before I copy it to the clipboard and paste it to the button using PasteFace(). This seems to have no effect.<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nHas anyone been able to set transaparent custom icons on the classic UI? Any concrete code examples would be greatly appreciated.<br />\n",
