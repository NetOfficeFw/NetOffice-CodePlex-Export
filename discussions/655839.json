It seems to be just as difficult as ever to get installed and runinng reliably on a clients machine.\r<br />\nI am new to .net and the NetOffice so I have a bit of a learning curve. I got an addin developed (Using NetOffice) by a freelance, who is no longer around and I am trying to debug it and create some setups.\r<br />\nI think I need to create a new project in order to get all the paths correct, opening the old solution file on my new PC just doesn't work.\r<br />\nhere is my first problem. What type of project do I need to create ?\r<br />\nI tried &quot; create new project from existing code&quot; but builds with more than 1000 errors.\r<br />\nShould I use a class file type?\r<br />\nI have VS 2015 community edition\r<br />\n<br />\nAny advice would be really appreciated.\r<br />\nI am tempted to just find a freelancer again but I am really keen to learn\r<br />\n<br />\nThank sin advance\r<br />\n<br />\nEd<br />\n",

    "Html": "hello there,\r<br />\n<br />\nfirst of it all: thank you very much. 13 years ago, i end my development in COM/Office with visual basic 6 and start to join the .net idea. \r<br />\n<br />\nIf you want to create an addin, you need to create a &quot;Class Library&quot; project in Visual studio. BTW: the NetOffice examples give you good point to start from.\r<br />\nYou find example addin projects in the &quot;$NetVersion\\Examples\\Addins&quot; folder. (there are 2 options here, the plain IExtensibility2 interface addins like VB6 or the NetOffice.Tools based Addin projects which is more familar to VSTO)\r<br />\n<br />\nThe 1000 errors problem sounds like reference problem. (thats all what i can say at this point, or may a syntax problem, i dont know)  make sure to disable the &quot;Embed Interop Types&quot; option for each NetOffice assembly. in other words, goto the references explorer, mark each NetOffice assembly and disable &quot;Embedd Interop Types&quot;\r<br />\nin the property grid.\r<br />\n<br />\n(If you need a freelancer again, please let me know)\r<br />\n*Sebastian<br />\n",

I was able to step through and resolve the immediate issues.<br>\r\nI think the problem is that the addin is installing on all live workbooks not just the target one.
