NuGet packages and &quot;products having permission to establish internet connection&quot; are <strong>not related</strong>.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>1</strong>-) Anyone can have their own <strong>private</strong> NuGet feed (you just have to put the packages in a folder in the file system), and there's no need for internet access and that's actually what lots of .NET shops do, so that their employees can use only the NuGet packages that have been &quot;approved&quot; by some IT Lead.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"http://content.screencast.com/users/caioproiete/folders/Snagit/media/8131a7c1-4d7f-490f-9869-dc772d5a9afc/09.29.2013-19.54.png\" alt=\"Image\" /><br />\n<br />\n<strong>2</strong>-) You don't need Visual Studio to download NuGet packages... You can use simple HTTP tools to download them, if you wish. For example, to download the NetOffice.Excel package:<br />\n<pre><code>wget -O NetOffice.Excel http://packages.nuget.org/api/v1/package/NetOffice.Excel/1.6.0.0\nunzip NetOffice.Excel 'lib/*'\n</code></pre>\n\n<strong>3</strong>-) No one is obligated to use the main <a href=\"http://nuget.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">NuGet.org</a> feed. Anyone can download the package definition from my GitHub repository (<a href=\"https://github.com/CaioProiete/NetOffice-NuGet\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/CaioProiete/NetOffice-NuGet</a>) and build the packages themselves.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>4</strong>-) If that makes you (and possibly other people) happy, I could host the generated NuGet packages on the same GitHub repository, just so people can download from there rather than downloading from the NuGet.org feed (if that is the problem). I could also host the packages on a <a href=\"http://www.myget.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">MyGet</a> feed as well (again, if NuGet.org is a concern for anyone). Actually you could host the NuGet packages here in CodePlex if you want - happy to help if you need.<br />\n<br />\nDoes that clarify things a little for you?<br />\n<br />\nNuGet is a package manager that helps manage dependencies of a .NET application... Any professional developer should be using it.<br />\n<br />\nNot wanting your Visual Studio to connect to the Internet is your choice, but that has nothing to do with embracing NuGet as your package manager.<br />\n<br />\nCheers,<br />\nCaio Proiete<br />\n",

    "Html": "hello caio, hansel,\r<br />\n<br />\nas i start with netoffice some people ask me for nuget package(some years ago). i try nuget and see its just a stupid addin and try to establish an internet connection directly(visual stuidio impersination). i'm affraid! i ask in the nuget board for solutions and a guy told me to use the nuget console and delete my issue <em>have a nice day</em>. i study the nuget code for a while and it looks safe, yes. what i say since 1998 a serious addin doesnt try to establish an internet connection directly. perform any kind of ipc communication to deal with an external process(.exe) to give the local firewall a chance. its okay for me to give nuget the permissions to establish a https connection to a specific remote point but not more! (see my google translation addin for office in the download section. it's demonstrate what i mean)<br />\n\r<br />\ncaio: i have no problems to manage my depencies on my own. sometimes i find the older version is better or i will waiting for while to see the new version is stable. is the dependency problem the biggest for a developer? i think no. its just a small problem and costs nothing to handle this at hand. you win control man!!\r<br />\n<br />\nhansel: i want add a specific firewall rule to see what can nuget do for me. which protocoll use nuget currently for communication? the nuget gallery has a generic uri/ip and port?\r<br />\n<br />\n*Sebastian<br />\n",
