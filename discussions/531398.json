The first replaces the bookmark with the required value, and the second is what I was hoping would change the size<br />\n<pre><code>        public static void ReplaceText(string Bookmark, string NewText)\n        {\n            if (newDocument.Bookmarks.Exists(Bookmark))\n            {                \n                newDocument.Bookmarks[Bookmark].Range.Text = NewText;\n            }\n        }\n        public static void ChangeFontSize(string Bookmark, float font_size)\n        {\n            if (newDocument.Bookmarks.Exists(Bookmark))\n            {                \n                newDocument.Bookmarks[Bookmark].Range.Font.Size = font_size;\n            }\n         }</code></pre>\n\nWhen I execute the ChangeFontSize method the new size is NOT set.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf someone has an answer it would be appreciated\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks\r<br />\n<br />\nDave<br />\n",
