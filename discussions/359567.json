When i iterate to the particular row, i get a com exception stating cells are vertically merged so basically cannot proceed. Right now to avoid this i am physically splitting\r\n the merged cells.</p>\r\n<p>Is there a better way? Can i detect tables/rows&nbsp; with merged cells upfront and then split the cells pro-grammatically?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\r\n<p>regards</p>\r\n<p>Sameer</p>\r\n",
