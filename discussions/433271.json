The WPF control is hosted using ElementHost on a Winforms UserControl.\r<br />\n<br />\nHowever, I have not been able to get the Drag Drop event handlers to fire.\r<br />\n<br />\nI have enabled Drop by setting AllowDrop to True on all the controls. I have also set the background to transparent.\r<br />\n<br />\nHas anyone tried this and got it working? Is there something in NetOffice that is preventing drag and drop, or some property I have to set.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks\r<br />\nChris<br />\n",
