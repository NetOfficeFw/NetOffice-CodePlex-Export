Now we have fast start up times and we do not need the ugly VSTO-Runtime anymore.\r<br />\n<br />\nGreat work!\r<br />\n<br />\nIt would be nice when your library can support Office 2016 in the near future. Today I have installed the preview of Office 2016 and your library gave me an error message box in Outlook:\r<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Initialize: Outlook version is not defined. SetOutlookVersion.&quot;\r<br />\n<br />\nKirk Koenigsbauer wrote in his Blog:\r<br />\n<br />\n&quot;We’re not making any changes to Macros or Add-ins in this release. It’s rare that “no changes” is a something we’d want to highlight, but we think it’s worth celebrating the consistency in the programming model across releases. We understand how important this is and we’re committed to a high level of compatibility as we continue to innovate.&quot;\r<br />\n<br />\nSo I think that the Office 2016 API is full compatible to the Office 2013 API.\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards\r<br />\n<br />\nNico<br />\n",
