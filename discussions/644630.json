(few features missing)\r<br />\n<br />\nAnyway, the MS Office COM Api is &quot;no longer made&quot;. MSFT did not any changes(he say). In other words: Office 2016 is excactly the same as Office 2013 (from COM-based developer perspective) You can use Office 2016 right now in NetOffice without worries. The only drop act is the intellisense and toolbox support is not up-to-date.\r<br />\n<br />\n*Sebastian<br />\n",

I didnt use Office 2016 at home(and i dont have a legal licence here right now) For this reason i use the workstations in the company i work for to create NetOffice. I dont know why but my company need a bit to update Office and Windows to its current state. Today we got Win10(x64) and Office 2016 for all employees in my company. <em>yeah</em> :) I'm ready now and want update NetOffice very very soon(ASAP). \r<br />\n <br />\nMoreover i still work for a guideline to see whats different in Office 2016. Yes its true - the COM API is the same but MS do some changes in behavior.\r<br />\nIf anyone read this and find some differents(in behaviour) in Office2016, please answer or contact me.\r<br />\n<br />\n*Sebastian<br />\n",
