I used NuGet to install <strong>NetOffice Excel</strong> to my IDE so that I could use it to create and save Excel <strong>workbooks</strong> on the site.   Everything worked perfectly in the IDE but it failed when I tried to deploy it to the <strong>IIS7</strong> web server.   It is showing the error message\r<br />\n&quot;<strong>System.ArgumentException: progId not found. Excel.Application</strong>&quot;.  <br />\nCan anyone explain to me exactly what are the detailed steps that need to happen to deploy successfully.   Since I'm new to this product I'm not confident that I understand all that I need to know about how it really works. so don't worry about your explanation being too simple or too detailed.   Your help is greatly appreciated.<br />\n",
