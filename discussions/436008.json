    "Html": "Hi all,\r<br />\n<br />\nI am trying to port from VBA to .NET one of my old applications to transliterate the content of an Excel sheet to and from cyrillic codepage. For that I need to access the individual characters in each cell, as cells or parts of cells that are formatted in italic must stay invariant in the process.\r<br />\n<br />\nI am stuck with this (simplified) version of my code:<br />\n<pre><code>Excel.Range theRange = exlSheet.UsedRange;            \nExcel.Range theCell;\nint rowsCt = theRange.Rows.Count;\nint colsCt = theRange.Columns.Count;\nfor (int iRow = 1; iRow &lt;= rowsCt; iRow++)\n      {\n           for (int iCol = 1; iCol &lt;= colCt; iKol++)\n            {\n                 // this the current cell\n                  theCell = theRange.Cells[iRow, iCol];\n                </code></pre>\n\nAfter this row I thought I intended to use the Characters object to loop through the individual characters in the cell, but this:<br />\n<pre><code>for (int iChar = 1; i &lt;= theCell.Characters.Count; i++)\n{\n      if (theCell.Characters[iChar, 1].Font.FontStyle = &quot;Italic&quot;) \n      {\n           ...</code></pre>\n\ndoesn't work, although it works in VBA code. \r<br />\nVisual Studio displays a red squiggly line with a tooltip text &quot;Cannot apply indexing with [] to an expression of type 'NetOffice.ExcelApi.Characters'&quot;.\r<br />\n<br />\nI understand what the problem is, but I see no other way to work character by character in the cell.\r<br />\nI need that because I know no other way to find parts of cell content that are formatted in italic except to loop through the cell characters and note the beginnings and ends of the italic parts, and then transliterate only the parts that are not in italic.\r<br />\n<br />\nI use NetOffice 1.0 with .NET Framework 3.5.\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you in advance for any help.<br />\n",

    "Html": "Thank you for your reply.\r<br />\n<br />\nUnfortunately, it doesn't work, for the syntax you propose Visual Studio says &quot;Non-invocable member 'ExcelApi.Range.Characters' cannot be used like a method&quot;, which makes sense, Characters is not a method of a Range type object,, and the syntax with rounded brackets can't work.\r<br />\n<br />\nI also downloaded and tried with NetOffice 1.5, but I get the same behavior and message.<br />\n",

    "Html": "Finally solved it. <br />\nThe problem was the fact that the Characters property of the Range object is not directly usable in .NET in the same form as it is in VBA. As there is no Character object, it is necessary to use the get_Characters method of the Range object to extract a range that is one character long, and then work with that character. So, this code works:<br />\n<pre><code>for (int iChar = 1; i &lt;= theCell.Characters.Count; i++)\n{\n      Excel.Collection oneChar = theCell.get_Characters(iChar, 1): \n      if ((bool)oneChar.Font.Italic) \n      {\n         ...</code></pre>\n\n",
