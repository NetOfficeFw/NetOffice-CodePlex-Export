Instead of opening all of them one after the other, I'm going to use a .NET app able to&nbsp;open this documents, analyse it,&nbsp;calculates&nbsp;metrics and finally close it... However, for&nbsp;some unknown reasons when i open a document using NETOffice, macros are enabled and thus&nbsp;functions like Workbook_Open are called... I don't want that to happen because they may modify the data or worse display a msgbox that would block my app...</p>\r\n<p>Is there a way to disable macros and still have access to VBOM?</p>\r\n<p><br />Thx,</p>\r\n<p>S&eacute;b</p>",

You need a kind of safe mode, start the application just for automation. this is not easy, please remember, NetOffice is an 1:1 Wrapper, no own ideas inside, only a little bit xtra stuff. its a logical office problem here.&nbsp; lets try the easiest way for you:<br /><br />Excel.Application application&nbsp;= new Excel.Application();<br />application.EnableEvents = false; // excel dont throw any events for VBA now.</p>\n<p><br />helps?</p>",
