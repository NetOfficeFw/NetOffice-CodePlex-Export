This presentation has a special slide, which allows the user to enter values via an OLE TextBox. <br />\nNow, I'd like to register an event-handler, for e.g. when the TextBox loses the input focus, or the user presses an &quot;OK&quot;-button.<br />\nHowever, I can't figure out how to register an event-handler with an OLE-Control. Is this Even possible? Is there another way to be notified when the user has entered some values?<br />\n",

Means an element from VBA or its an external Active-X control?\r<br />\n(first case is easy but a dialog want shown for the user to agree your access to VBA. The PowerPoint security settings can level this but its not recommended.\r<br />\nsecond case is more challenging. you need the .net interop wrapper for the control to handle this normaly with += new EventHandler, otherwise you need some special code to do this on demand with COM Connection Containers. May i can help your here if its the scenario )<br />\n\r<br />\n*Sebastian<br />\n",
