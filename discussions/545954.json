It has definitely made things a lot more organized and easier when dealing with the <em>Microsoft.Office.Interop</em> libraries.<br />\n<br />\nI have a question concerning the use of a field property. The following code would normally just work under the <em>Microsoft.Office.Interop.Access</em> and <em>Microsoft.Office.Interop.Dao</em> namespaces.<br />\n<pre><code>// open database\n\nApplication app = new Application()\nDatabase db = app.DBEngine.Workspaces[0].OpenDatabase(filePath);\nTableDef myTable = db.TableDefs[tableName];\nField myField = myTable.Fields[&quot;FirstName&quot;];\nProperties myProperties = myField.Properties;   //I get 39 properties for myField\nProperty fieldTextAlign = myProperties[&quot;TextAlign&quot;];\nvar value = fieldTextAlign .Value;</code></pre>\n\nCurrently when I look at the Properties and Property Class in NetOffice, I get an error:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>\nbase = {&quot;Class not exists: NetOffice.AccessApi.Property&quot;}<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nMicrosoft intellisense shows that <strong>Properties</strong> is in the NetOffice.DAOApi namespace even though my original application object (app) belongs in the AccessApi namespace. How do I access these properties. I tried casting but could not make it work. Any help greatly appreciated.<br />\n<br />\nDun<br />\n",

Basically I am trying to get the value of  <strong>&quot;TextAlign&quot;, &quot;Caption&quot;, and &quot;Description&quot;</strong>  properties from a table field in Microsoft Access. Do you have any examples of getting the values of these properties from a table field? <br />\n<br />\nThank you.<br />\nDun<br />\n",
