It has no&nbsp;return value. The process kicks off a web service call based on input parameters ﻿﻿asychronously</p>\n<p>When getting response back from web service, it will plot result in Excel cells, data could be many rows * columns. After this process, undo button in Excel becomes disabled.&nbsp; not sure why. So users can't undo previous steps.</p>\n<p>I do not want to code undo myself and just want to use Excel built-in undo if possible</p>",
