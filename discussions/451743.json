This could be a suggestion to develop in future editions of NetOffice Toolbox to have this functionality.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe reason why I am going for an installation is that I cannot register the program (via regasm) on my work computer. I do not have administration rights and I have Windows 7. This is why I have to create deployment package to get around this. So the aim is to create a deployment package home where I have administration rights and install the add in at work.\r<br />\n<br />\nI was aware of open source deployment software like WiX Toolset and NSIS however have no idea how to use it. Do you have experience in open source deployment .NET software.<br />\n",
