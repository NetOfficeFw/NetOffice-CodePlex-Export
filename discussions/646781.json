No mouse event has any action but in the document itsself you can select and write in a normal way.\r<br />\n<br />\nAfter the user minimizes Word and reopens it, the Word Ribbon Bar is again completly useable.\r<br />\n<br />\nThis effects is not reproducable but on 100 machines every day onr user tells about this problem.\r<br />\nThe next creation on the same document dows not have this effect.\r<br />\n<br />\nHas anyone the same problem or can tell me how to avoid this?\r<br />\nI myself has no more idea :-(<br />\n",
