(but not a plugin). \r<br />\n<br />\nFrom the companion app, I need to find Word instance of a given filename. \r<br />\n<br />\nBut it doesn't seem to work. \r<br />\n<br />\nIf I have 3 word instances open, and I do this: <br />\n<pre><code>                foreach (Application word_application in Application.GetActiveInstances())\n                {\n                    foreach (Window window in word_application.Windows)\n                    {\n                        if (filename == window.Document.FullName)\n                        {\n                            //Do good stuff here\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n\n</code></pre>\n\nit doesn't work. \r<br />\n<br />\nApplication.GetActiveInstances() returns 3 applications, \r<br />\n<br />\nbut window is always the same, first instance. \r<br />\n<br />\nHow can I get to the file I need?\r<br />\n<br />\nMany thanks. <br />\n",
