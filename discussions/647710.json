I load the project into VS 2015 Community and set a breakpoint on the About click .  I run it using F5.  Word 2010 loads and the addin installs.  I click on About and the message shows the it doesn't breakpoint.  If I debug a simple C# program it breakpoints fine.  I have never debugged a DLL.  Is there something I need to set?\r<br />\n<br />\nI cleaned the project and built it again.  I checked the debug properties and everything appears right, at least to me.  I set breakpoints on other lines and nothing works.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny suggestions are appreciated.<br />\n",
