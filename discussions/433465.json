In the custom pane I want to list the file names using lables (creating a new label for each file name).\r<br />\n<br />\nI understand how to code the custom pane properties however I do not know how to use open file dialog boxes in VB (I did in VBA).\r<br />\n<br />\nNote I am using developer toolbox with visual studio express 2010 and 2012. Also this is the first time I am adding code in visual studio express.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf you require me to explain anything further, let me know. Any help on this matter would be much appreciated. Thanks<br />\n",

I have to create a new form right to create a custom task pane. I was wanting to add a listbox to a custom task pane (similar to the form used as the navigation pane in word 2010).\r<br />\n<br />\nIf the above sounds confusing it is because my understanding is still at a basic level.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks again for your help<br />\n",
