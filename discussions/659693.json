I just get the error you cannot run it as it is a class library dll.<br />\nI am using VS2015, and I chose outlook automation.<br />\n<br />\nAlso all of the tutorials are in german! :(<br />\nI need to develop task panes for outlook child windows (email message, task window etc), and with no documentation on this I may need to go back to VSTO.<br />\n",
