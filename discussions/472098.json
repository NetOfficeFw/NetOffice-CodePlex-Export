(or use the the latest source state, or modify the 1.6 source code(Outlook\\Tools\\COMAddin.cs), otherwise wait a week for NO 1.7)<br />\n<br />\nsorry men for any convenience :(<br />\n*Sebastian<br />\n",

I just played a bit with the registry keys, and I think that it is likely that it is an Outlook-Issue.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhat I did is this: \r<br />\n<br />\nSelected a working Outlook-Addin that is installed locally on my PC<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Exported all relevant Registry Keys into regfiles (*.reg)</li>\n<li>Deleted all Registry Keys, that I exported before</li>\n<li>Changed the path of the registry Keys in the Regfiles from HKCU to HKLM</li>\n<li>\nImported the modified regfiles.<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nEffect: The Addin was gone in Outlook. \r<br />\n<br />\nThe reason of this experiment was that the Prerelease-Version of Netoffice 1.7 that you released (<a href=\"https://netoffice.codeplex.com/downloads/get/737223\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://netoffice.codeplex.com/downloads/get/737223</a>) did not solve the issue.\r<br />\n<br />\nOh, btw: Wouldn't it be easier if we discussed this in German? :-)<br />\n",
