I built and ran Outlook. &nbsp;Everything continued to work fine.</p>\r\n<p>I then put the AssemblyVersion back to 1.0.0.0, and built and ran Outlook. &nbsp;The Add-in did not load. &nbsp;The COM Add-Ins window reports &quot;Not loaded. &nbsp;A runtime error occurred during the loading of the COM Add-in.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>I then changed the AssemblyVersion back to 1.0.2.0 . Built and ran and everything worked fine.</p>\r\n<p>I can live with this... but its bugging me that I can't figure out what's happening. &nbsp;I've tried manually unregistering and registering the assembly (I'm using the /codebase option). &nbsp;I do not see my assembly in the GAC. &nbsp;I see nothing in\r\n DbgView. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Is the Assembly version cached somewhere? &nbsp;Is Netoffice caching it and checking that the version its about to load isn't older? &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Any light you can shed would be helpful. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>\r\n",
