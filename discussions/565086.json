So far I have been able to edit the font in a cell but only 1 character at a time which gets really slow with a lot of text.\r<br />\n<br />\nThis works setting &quot;position&quot; in a little for loop but I'm sure is wildly inefficient not setting a whole range at a time:<br />\n<pre><code>table.Cell(row, column).Range.Characters[position].Font.Size = 10;\ntable.Cell(row, column).Range.Characters[position].Font.Bold = 1;\ntable.Cell(row, column).Range.Characters[position].Font.Italic = 0;</code></pre>\n\nThanks!<br />\n",
