If I type it in directly it works????<br />\n\r<br />\nI am using Visual Studio 2015 and have had a few issues using NetOffice classes not showing correctly with Intellisense.  Anyone else having this issue?<br />\n",

I've been changed this in latest source state and want publish them in NetOffice 1.7.4 if you find more hidden stuff - please let me know.\r<br />\n<br />\nBTW: An easy bypass for the issue is to activate the option &quot;show hidden/advanced members&quot; in the VS Tools/Options menu(restart recommended).\r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n*Sebastian<br />\n",
