Thanx very much.\r<br />\n<br />\nI have a new problem, which is with excel, not with the NET.OFFICE, but its related and i hoped you will be able to give me a clue.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen my addon opens it tries to do the following code line, which fails:\r<br />\nObject ExcelProxy = System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.GetActiveObject(&quot;Excel.Application&quot;);\r<br />\n<br />\nI made a lot of research and it turns out that office registers itself in the ROT only when it loses focus, and not on startup. So my addin cant find in there. I cant find a way to make it loose focus and register itself to the ROT, or a way to cause the addin window to steal the focus from excel.\r<br />\n<br />\nDid you ever encounter such an issue?\r<br />\n<br />\nThis is a known issue at Microsoft and theres a workaround that doesnt work for me at least:\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316125/EN-US/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316125/EN-US/</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks<br />\n",
