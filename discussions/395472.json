I have office 2010 installed on my box locally and noticed that it is at the root of a failed Excel paste call. Using Excel Interop 14 libraries the paste worksheet method always\r\n gives me:&nbsp;<strong>That command cannot be used on multiple selections.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Running the same application on a box that only has Interop 12 alleviates said issues. Is there a way to force Interop 12 as opposed to 14 without uninstalling Office 2010 in favor of Office 2007?</p>\r\n<p>Cheers</p>\r\n",
