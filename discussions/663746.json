More than 5 years of my life, i discover this journey, with good and bad times on codeplex.  I like Codeplex because it is not just a platform to share code from one developer to another like github, and is not only a platform to share open source applications like sourceforge - it is both together. Nice Landing Pages for end-customers and powerful code sharing behind. This is why codeplex is unique.<br />\n<br />\n(Thanks to Mark Grooves - the best codeplex chief Microsoft ever had and Jonathan Wanagel and all the others)<br />\n<br />\nI will miss codeplex&lt;3<br />\n<br />\n*Sebastian<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAny last message are welcome here<br />\n",
