When an image is selected it is &quot;Picture tools&quot; when a table is selected it is 'Table tools&quot; and when a normal paragraph is selected the tools\r\n section does not show.</p>\r\n<p>How can i detect this behavior using word interop/Net office API?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks Sameer</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",
