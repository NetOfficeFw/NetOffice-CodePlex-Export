    "Html": "<p>hello,<br /><br />the source code doesnt contains signed solutions. one of the ideas of signing is trusted publishing as far i known. the assembly signing makes sure the assembly is from NetOffice himself. in other words: all release assemblies are signed but never the source. i dont publish the key files here. you can create your own fork and sign of course. if you want a custom version with the original keyfiles please send me your source code. I take look, already was okay and sign your solution(NetOffice is Free Software and dont do evil at all) Why you need a ciustom version of NetOffice. You want to shrink the assemblies?&nbsp; If you have suggestions then i can integrate your ideas in NetOffice.<br /><br />Sebastian<br /><br /><br /></p>",
