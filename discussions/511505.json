    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\nI devoloped a small Word add-in with Ribbon-bar. For developing the add-in I have admin rights. Everything works nice inkluding testing in Word. Now I tried to registrate the add-in at an user-account without admin rights (same computer). I used Inno Script for a setup (see <a href=\"http://netoffice.codeplex.com/discussions/435058\" rel=\"nofollow\">discussion:435058</a>) and started the setup with runas for admin-rights. Setup finished. After that I used a .reg for registation the add-in for the lokal user ([HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software....], see <a href=\"http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=netoffice&amp;DownloadId=472623\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a>). That was also accepted. So far so good.\r<br />\n<br />\nAt the start-up-screen of Word 2010 my add-in is also shown. When a new Word-document is open my add-in (Ribbon-bar) ist not included in Word.  Now &quot;LaodBehavior&quot; of the [HKey_current_user...] is 2 instead of 3 (value in the .reg). Concerning <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/bb386106.aspx#LoadBehavior\" rel=\"nofollow\">MS</a> this means an error is accured during add-in loading.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny idea what the error could be? or how could i get the error message?\r<br />\n<br />\nadditional information: I used 5 five Forms in the add-in. Win 7 64bit, VS Express 2012, Office 2010 (32 bit), NetOffice.DeveloperToolbox\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for any help<br />\n",

I had a lot of work, so my free-time project (word add-in) got a minor priority.\r<br />\n<br />\nTo ehudklein and mkiruba: Thanks for your replay. They were a help.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe problem was much easier than I thoght. The Problem was in front of the computer. I forgot to include the RibbonUI.xml in the Inno Script (being embarrassed). So the environment variable VSTO_SUPPRESSDISPLAYALERTS and the hint with the RibbonUI.xml showed very quick the problem.\r<br />\n<br />\nInstead of environment variable VSTO_SUPPRESSDISPLAYALERTS I used <a href=\"http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/AddInSpy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">AddInSpy</a>. For me it was a bit easier to work with.\r<br />\n<br />\nPerhaps my stupid mistake help other.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for help<br />\n",
