An excellent masterpiece for sure.\r<br />\nHowever, with installation of the same upon my machine with VS2010 as well as VS2013 (Both Professional Versions) I have found that the wizard doesn't appear in startup screen in any of them.\r<br />\nFurthermore I have found the controls on the forms/taskpanes appearing in basic rectangular shapes instead of the finished smooth rounded corner ones viewed in the design mode in the Studio itself.\r<br />\nAny reason for the same and manner to overcome the same?\r<br />\nThanx in advance.<br />\n",
