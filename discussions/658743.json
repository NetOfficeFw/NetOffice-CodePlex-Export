Indian People is strictly prohibited to use this software !!!&quot;.\r<br />\n<br />\nI would like some clarification why this was done and what does it mean for the NetOffice project and its MIT License.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs the NetOffice library and its source still subject to the MIT License? (<a href=\"http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/</a> )\r<br />\nCan any further source code released in NetOffice project be used under the unmodified MIT License?\r<br />\n<br />\nWhat does the newly added sentence mean for customers who use NetOffice libraries in their projects? Are they liable if the software using NetOffice libraries is used by &quot;Indian people&quot;?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for clarification.<br />\n",
