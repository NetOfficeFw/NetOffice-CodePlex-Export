    "Html": "<p>okay, the problem is by design. the CLR AppDomain Exception Handling doesnt works with unmanaged threads. i create a new VS Wizard at the moment with COM Shimming support. Shimming make it possible to handle this problem. I need ~1 month for this feature(not easy). If you need a solution right now then use the COM Shim Wizard from Microsoft. an example is available in the download section. if you have questions about the Shim wizard an NetOffice then please contact me again :-)<br /><br />Sebastian</p>",
