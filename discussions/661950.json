After switching to use NetOffice.OutlookApi, I am getting a compile time error saying NavigationModule cannot be casted into a CalendarModule. \r<br />\nAfter playing with it for a while, I was unable to find any way of getting the NavigationGroup from the CalendarModule.\r<br />\n<br />\n<em>Can you think of anything that I may be able to try?</em><br />\n<blockquote>\nI have been switching over to NetOffice for a few weeks now and this is the first issue I have been unable to solve myself.
