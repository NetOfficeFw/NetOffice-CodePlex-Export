Typical is you can use &gt;90% old code without changes)<br />\n<br />\nSebastian<br />\n",

You also have to know, NO use Enums in seperate Sub-Namespaces, for example NetOffice.WordApi.Enums or NetOffice.OfficeApi.Enums:<br />\n<br />\nMoreover, its highly recommended to study the first 3 tutorials about com proxy management. A short explanation to compare the scenario is <a href=\"https://netoffice.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Tec_Documentation_English_Management\" rel=\"nofollow\">online available</a>.<br />\n",
