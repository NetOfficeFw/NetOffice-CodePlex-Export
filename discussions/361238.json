I say this because I feel the 'microsoft' argument a bit long in the tooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. NuGet Can be Deployed Standalone, and is fully compilable from source, if your security concious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. NuGet is a very opensource driven system (is this not we have always want from the more enterprise development 'houses')<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. If you use any microsoft production, it has access to the internet, period i.e. The Start Page in VS.NET, Help in any of the others)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.

I'm sorry that you have decieded to drop the platform...
