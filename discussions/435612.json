What happens is, that I see Visio beeing started, and also closed at the end.

Just some more digging required.\r<br />\n<br />\nFrom what I currently understand the &quot;current release download package&quot; does not support Visio due to the &quot;keytoken bug&quot; that has already been fixed. (95603) \r<br />\nWhen I download the latest source code and link against the DLLs provided there, all works fine (no more errors)\r<br />\n<br />\nI would be great if you could include the fix already in the main download packages and e.g. go up to v1.5.1.3, so no more people are forced to stumble across this ;)\r<br />\n<br />\nAnyhow thanks for your great work! <br />\n",
