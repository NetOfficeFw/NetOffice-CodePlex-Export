    "Html": "Hi!\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for your reply.  The documentation wasn't always wrong - it is how my current Office 2010 addin does it without issue.\r<br />\n<br />\nI've already gone down another road - going to bite the bullet and get Add-in Express.  All my code just works with the trial version, and I've spent too much time on this already.  :(\r<br />\n<br />\nUnfortunately, I can't use the OutlookMAPIFolder option.  I think that just gets the user's calendar.  I actually need the CalendarModule so that I can get a reference to the Other Calendars group...<br />\n<pre><code>Dim objGroup As Outlook.NavigationGroup\nobjGroup = objCalendarModule.NavigationGroups.GetDefaultNavigationGroup(Outlook.OlGroupType.olOtherFoldersGroup)</code></pre>\n\n... and eventually check if the user's department SharePoint calendar is under objGroup.NavigationFolders.  If not, I add it.\r<br />\n<br />\nI also found a bug in NetOffice and submitted the fix in GitHub.  It's when you want to register your addin under HKLM.\r<br />\n<br />\nAnd I also hit another showstopper with the NetOffice conversion. ( I don't mean to sideline the topic, but I wanted to let you know in case you want to take a look and make enhancements.)  This one was with trying to handle the ModuleSwitch event<br />\n<pre><code>Private ObjPane As Outlook.NavigationPane  ' needs to be defined outside of the startup event handler because it is referenced the definition of the ModuleSwitch event handler\nObjPane = Application.ActiveExplorer.NavigationPane\nAddHandler ObjPane.ModuleSwitchEvent, New Outlook.NavigationPane_ModuleSwitchEventHandler(AddressOf NavigationPane_ModuleSwitch)</code></pre>\n\nBut in the handler, I am given Nothing for theModule.  I need to check if it's the Calendar module that was opened, but can't.<br />\n<pre><code>    Private Sub NavigationPane_ModuleSwitch(ByVal theModule As Outlook.NavigationModule)</code></pre>\n\nThanks for your awesome work, and it was a pleasure working with it, but at least in my case, it didn't seem complete in the areas that I needed.<br />\n",
