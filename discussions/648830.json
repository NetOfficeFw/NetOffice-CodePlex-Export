    "Html": "Hi All,\r<br />\n<br />\nI've been using NetOffice to develop an Outlook 2013 plugin. Since I am using the WordEditor as well, I selected Outlook and Word in the developer toolbox, and at the end I selected to Customize the Ribbon and that I want to add a Task Pane.\r<br />\n<br />\nNow when the project is originally created, I had to make some modifications for the plugin to show up in outlook, and I ended up with this code:<br />\n<pre><code>&lt;COMAddin(&quot;Moist&quot;, &quot;My Outlook Integrated Support Tool&quot;, 3), ProgId(&quot;Moist.Addin&quot;), Guid(&quot;3C0FB897-8026-4AD3-8599-4DFCA3FF873E&quot;)&gt;\n&lt;RegistryLocation(RegistrySaveLocation.CurrentUser), CustomUI(&quot;Moist.RibbonUI.xml&quot;), CustomPane(GetType(MyTaskPane), &quot;My TaskPane&quot;, True, PaneDockPosition.msoCTPDockPositionRight)&gt;</code></pre>\n\nalso I changed the inherits to:<br />\n<pre><code>Inherits Outlook.Tools.COMAddin</code></pre>\n\nNow when I registered the DLL with RegAsm.Exe it showed up in outlook perfectly, even the task pane.\r<br />\n<br />\nI created all the functions I needed, and then zipped all the assembly and all other DLLs.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen I tried to register the Assembly on another computer (same windows, same version of outlook) when the user starts outlook the following error message appears:<br />\n<blockquote>\nan error occurred in CTPFactoryAvailable<br />\n</blockquote>\nI did a mad search, but found no such function (or word) in my solution in VS Express. I did some Googling, and found that this function is in the IEXtensibilty examples, so I guess it's part of the DLLs accompanying my assembly.\r<br />\n<br />\nDo you guys have any idea, why I would get the task pane error? It seems to work perfectly on my computer, and I used the exact same DLLs in the Debug Folder on the other computer.\r<br />\n<br />\nI created a new project, just with the task pane, completely blank and tried that on the other computer, still nothing, I just get the &quot;an error occurred in CTPFactoryAvailable&quot; when outlook launches.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny help would be much appreciated.\r<br />\n<br />\nMany thanks,\r<br />\nKrisz<br />\n",

For me now, its an exception in the ctor of your pane or in a corresponding event trigger or last but not least, a dependent assembly is missing.  (please keep in your mind: CLR bind referenced assemblies while first access-on demand - may you use something special in your task pane)\r<br />\n<br />\nyou can send me a simplified version of your project to public.sebastian[at]web.de and i want see how it works in my virtual machines.(remove any private code if you want but keep all assembly references alive)\r<br />\n<br />\n*Sebastian<br />\n",
