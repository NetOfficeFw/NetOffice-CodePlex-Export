I have some images saved as resources (MyProject.Properties.Resources.SomeImage, as a System.Drawing.Bitmap), for email template generation. I was wondering if it was possible to add these images to a MailItem without having to save them to a temporary file on my computer, then upload the file again into an attachment (giving its path), then delete the temporary file once the email has been sent.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs it possible to use base64 encoding, and reference it with a cid or something similar?\r<br />\n<br />\nCould somebody post a short (2-3 line) code example? \r<br />\n<br />\nI've been struggling with this all day, any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />\n",

I want to attach it to a MailItem, and set its content id to some value.\r<br />\n<br />\nExample of what I would like to do is something like this:<br />\n<pre><code>// I have a variable called img that is of type System.Drawing.Bitmap\n\nvar att = mailItem.Attachments.Add( /* Add img here somehow? */);\natt.SetSomeProperty(&quot;someId&quot;); // Set the cid of att somehow?\nmailItem.HTMLBody = &quot;&lt;img src='cid:someId' /&gt;&quot;;</code></pre>\n\nI'm not getting a specific error, I just have no idea how to do this. Can I attach a System.Net.Mail.LinkedResource, or a Stream somehow?\r<br />\n<br />\nI hope this clarifies what I'm trying to do.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for taking the time to answer my question. :)<br />\n",
