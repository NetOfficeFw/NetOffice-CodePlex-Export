The problem is that I wanted to access the worksheets, cells etc... but the object Excel.Application isn't accessible from my popup class in any way. \r<br />\n(I noticed while browsing the net that Visual Studio automatically create a class called Globals with all the static objects from the package. Is there any mean to reproduce it ?)\r<br />\nMaybe some people have encountered the same issue ?\r<br />\nThank you for your help.\r<br />\n<br />\nBest regards,\r<br />\nImad. <br />\n",
