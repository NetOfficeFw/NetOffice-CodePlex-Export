If you develop a COMAddin that is being used by a 64Bit  Office application, you have to compile your assembly as x64. If you  wart to  support 32Bit and 64Bit Office applications, you may need to provide a  second x64-compiled COMAddin. This behaviour is the same in all  scenarios(interop,vsto or netoffice). A 64Bit application can only load  64Bit Dll's.If you use a 64Bit Office for testing  on your development system and you want to register your COMAddin while  compiling (Register for COM Interop), you need to keep in mind that  some older versions of Visual Studio call the 32Bit registration in that  case. In this case, you get the following error:</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><strong><br />\"File &lt;path to assembly&gt; is not a valid assembly\". </strong><br /> </span>You can read a workarround by Microsoft here: <br /> </span></span><a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/956933\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;\">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/956933</span></a></p>\r\n<p><br />this discussion may also helpful for you: http://netoffice.codeplex.com/discussions/346527<br /><br />Sebastian</p>",
