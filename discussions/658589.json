    "Html": "Thanks Sebastian for your great software.\r<br />\n<br />\nThere are some nuances that complicate the transition to NetOffice, because after the transition it is necessary for some time to fiind out why the code does not work so as it worked before.\r<br />\n<br />\nFor example, by using ExcelApi it is necessary to adapt (do anew)  Range.Resize[row, column] on Range.Resize(row, column). The same regards Offset.\r<br />\nInstead  .Names.Item(rangeName) it should be .Names[rangeName, null, null].\r<br />\nWork with optional arguments differs.\r<br />\n \r<br />\nIn issue Worksheet.Range is not an indexer (C#) (<a href=\"http://netoffice.codeplex.com/workitem/22314\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://netoffice.codeplex.com/workitem/22314</a>) you write that\r<br />\n \r<br />\n&quot;So Excel.Worksheet need a -real-simple Range property in NetOffice.\r<br />\n(The indexer comes from the Excel.Range class in your scenario)\r<br />\nThis is easy to fix in a minute :)&quot;\r<br />\n \r<br />\nIn this connection, I have a question, do you plan to release new versions of NetOffice  and where  can it be retrieved? \r<br />\n<br />\nBest regars,\r<br />\nSerge<br />\n",

I've been tried VB a lot of times with much more problems.\r<br />\n<br />\nIn fact: It is impossible to reproduce the Primary Interop Assemblies as 1:1. (Standard Interop Assemblies are no match for NetOffice of course)\r<br />\n<br />\nAll .Net languages doesnt allows what the COM standard doing here.\r<br />\nThe primary interop assemblies bypass any compiler rules and can do the magic\r<br />\n<br />\nYes, imitate the PIA's better in Excel as first is part of the todo list and fixed in the current source state.\r<br />\n<br />\n[OffTopic]\r<br />\nI have a new release right now for 1 year but Codeplex drop the support to my lovely Subversion(SVN), and i have no experience with Git at all, and i have no time to learn all about git to continue the contribution. \r<br />\n[/OffTopic]\r<br />\n<br />\n*Sebastian<br />\n",
