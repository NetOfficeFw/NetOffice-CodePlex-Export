When I test the add-in in PowerPoint, the task pane's background is a gradient of gray (it looks exactly like other task panes), but the user control on the pane has a solid white background over it. I would like the user control to be transparent. I tried to use UserControl.SetStyle(ControlStyles.SupportsTransparentBackColor, true) and set its BackColor to transparent, but without any effects.<br />\n<br />\nThanks for help,<br />\nMartin<br />\n",
