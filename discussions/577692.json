(this.Factory)\r<br />\n<br />\nThis breaking change want handle the problem that all unshimmed COM-Addins\r<br />\nwas loaded from office in the same appdomain. so you have 2 addin.dll's loaded(based on NetOffice)\r<br />\nboth addins share the static factory core and its stettings and this cause unwanted side effects.\r<br />\n<br />\n \r<br />\n*Sebastian <br />\n",
