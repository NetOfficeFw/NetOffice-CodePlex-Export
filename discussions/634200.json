Or any other threads?</strong>  Yes, I use a BackgroundWorker for some code that extracts the data from the currently selected email as I found that having it run on the main thread was slowing down Outlook.\r<br />\n<strong>Does any code calling COM objects run in finalizers?</strong>  No\r<br />\n<strong>Are there other add-in running on user machine?</strong>   Yes, the user tells me that he uses the Dragon Naturally Speaking add in to record voice into emails.<br />\n",
