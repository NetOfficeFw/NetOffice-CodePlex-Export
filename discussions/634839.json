After sending a mail I am going to save the mail to an archiving system, I need to extract the mail address of the recipients to connect it to the right objects in the other system. \r<br />\n<br />\nAs for now I can only get the mail address when sending mail to persons that are not in my contact list. When sending mails to contacts, it just gives me a cryptic string. \r<br />\n<br />\nSo I wonder, does anyone know how I can get the email address from my contacts?<br />\n",
